Does the anchor project compile without any warnings?
Just a small experimental warning.

  yarn run v1.22.22
  $ /home/gadzzaa/C3_Comets_Popescu_Ioan-Robert/C5/favorites/node_modules/.bin/ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 'tests/**/*.ts'
  (node:70796) ExperimentalWarning: Type Stripping is an experimental feature and might change at any time
  (Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)

  }

What is the name of the instruction handler?
  SetFavourites, i think?

The program has a ID, which is a pubkey.
Where does the secret key for this pubkey exist? Hint: it's in your
project.
  Is it in Anchor.toml at line 8?

  favorites = "31eTrr43nYd8CugaZHpkZJNDCTLc85g3Uc7YLspuXg1h"
